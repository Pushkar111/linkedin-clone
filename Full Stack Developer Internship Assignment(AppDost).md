**Full Stack Developer Internship Assignment Project Title: LinkedIn Clone– Simple Social Media Website(http://www.linkedin.com/)** 

**Project Description:** 

Create a simple web app like **LinkedIn**, where users can **sign up, log in, create posts**, and **see  posts from all other users**. 

This project will help you show your full stack development skills — **frontend \+ backend \+  database**. 

**Features to Build:** 

**1\. User Login & Signup** 

• Users should be able to **register** with email and password. 

• After registration, they should **log in** to use the website. 

• Once logged in, show the user’s name or profile on the top bar. 

**2\. Create Post** 

• After login, the user can **write a post** (text content, like “Hello world\!”). • Each post should have: 

o User’s name 

o Post text 

o Time when it was created 

**3\. View All Posts** 

• All users can see posts made by **every registered user** (like a public feed). • Show the latest posts first. 

**Bonus** 

• Add **like** or **comment** buttons on posts. 

• Allow users to **edit or delete** their own posts. 

• Add a simple **profile page** for each user.  
• Allow users to **upload an image** with their post. 

**Use These Technologies ** 

• **Frontend:** React.js 

• **Backend:** Node.js \+ Express.js 

• **Database:** MongoDB 

**How the App Should Work:** 

1\. User visits the site → sees a login/signup page. 

2\. After login → user can create a post. 

3\. All users’ posts appear on a common “Feed” page. 

4\. User can log out anytime. 

**What to Submit:** 

1\. **Live project link** (use Netlify/Vercel for frontend, Render/Railway for backend). 2\. **GitHub repo link** (with both frontend and backend code). 

3\. **README file** (explain: 

o How to run the project 

o What tech stack you used 

o Features you added) 

**Evaluation Points:** 

• Working signup/login system   
• Ability to create and view posts  

• Clean UI and responsive design  

• Extra features like like/comment/edit (optional)  

Once you’ve completed the task, upload your project to GitHub and deploy it (for free) on **Netlify** or **Vercel**. Then, share your GitHub repository link and deployed project link with us. 

Share both your **GitHub repository link** and **deployed project link** with us via email  "hr@appdost.in"
